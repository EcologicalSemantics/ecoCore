## About
This ontology aims to provide core semantics for ecological entities, such as ecological functions (for predators, prey, etc), food webs, and ecological interactions. Through ECOCORE, we look forward to creating a semantic rallying point for the ecological community, a need expressed repeatedly over the past few years at workshops focused on ecological, environmental, and population-based semantics.  We're working closely with the [Environment Ontology (ENVO)](http://www.obofoundry.org/ontology/envo.html), [Population and Community Ontology (PCO)](http://www.obofoundry.org/ontology/pco.html), the [Ontology of Biological Attributes (OBA)](www.obofoundry.org/ontology/oba.html), and the [Neuro Behavior Ontology (NBO)](http://www.obofoundry.org/ontology/nbo.html) to build a robust and interoperating resource. 

Naturally, the ontology is importing existing semantics where relevant, and has begun to channel requests for improvement to the hosting ontologies to promote collaboration.

# Acknowledgements

The first version of ECOCORE was built at the NSF-funded [ClearEarth Hackathon](http://instaar.colorado.edu/~jenkinsc/postings/BioHackathon/), organised by Chris Jenkins and [Anne Thesen](http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2908-3327), with input from ecologists, ontologists, and experts in natural language processing. The ontology was seeded with lists of terms generated as part of the hackathon.

This ontology repository was created using the [ontology starter kit](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-starter-kit)
